Loved by the men whom served under him and known for his intellect.  He is a candid speaker and has a great deal of wisdom to offer those around him.  Inviting General Mattis over for a sleep over would be of great benefit to all.  As the Presidents daughters are entering dating age, all potential suiters could be vetted by General Mattis before being allowed to take them on a date.  Only a fool would cross General Mattis. Moreover, needing nothing more than a cot and poncho liner, General Mattis would take up very little space.  In addition, this move would score points with the fiscal conservatives as you could lay off half the secret service staff guarding the White House.  It is a Win/Win if I ever saw one.

C'mon, you know you want to.  You've been stingy with those pardons.  Here's a great way to make up for it and there's plenty of precedent.  Lincoln, a Republican, pardoned the Southern rebels after the Civil  war.  Ford, a Republican, pardoned Viet Nam draft  dodgers. Ronald Reagan signed an amnesty for 2.7 million Mexican illegals.
